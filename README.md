# Notes App

This is a simple command-line notes application written in C.
I made this project to practice my C programming skills and learn more about file I/O, data structures, and user input handling.

## Features

- **Add Notes**: Create new notes with titles, content, and timestamps.
- **View Notes**: Display a list of all existing notes.
- **Edit Notes**: Modify the title, content, or timestamp of existing notes.
- **Delete Notes**: Remove unwanted notes from the list.
- **View Notes by Date**: Filter and display notes based on a specific date.
- **Settings**: Configure app settings such as color theme and language.

## How to Use

1. **Compile**: Compile the source code using a C compiler.
2. **Run**: Execute the compiled executable in your command-line interface.
3. **Navigate**: Use the menu to navigate through different actions.
4. **Interact**: Follow the prompts to perform desired actions like adding, editing, or deleting notes.

## Configuration

- The app's configuration settings are stored in `config.txt`.
- Customize settings such as maximum title/content length, color theme, and language.

## Translations

- Language translations are stored in `translations.txt`.
- Add or modify translations to support multiple languages.

## Build Instructions

1. **Clone**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Compile**: Use a C compiler to compile the source code files.
3. **Run**: Execute the compiled executable to launch the app.
